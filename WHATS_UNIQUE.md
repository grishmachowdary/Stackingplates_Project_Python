# 🌟 What Makes This Game UNIQUE?

## Why This Isn't Just Another Tower of Hanoi Clone

---

## 🔥 1. COMBO SYSTEM - Speed Meets Strategy

### What It Is
Real-time scoring multiplier that rewards quick consecutive moves.

### How It Works
- Make valid moves within 3 seconds → Combo increases
- 5+ combo = 2x multiplier (Yellow) ⚡
- 10+ combo = 3x multiplier (Orange) 🔥
- 15+ combo = 5x multiplier (Red - ON FIRE!) 🔥🔥
- Wait too long or invalid move → Combo breaks

### Why It's Unique
✅ Adds skill ceiling (speed + accuracy)
✅ Creates "flow state" gameplay
✅ Speedrunning potential
✅ Visual feedback (colors, glow, fire)
✅ Risk/reward balance

**No other puzzle game combines turn-based logic with real-time action scoring!**
